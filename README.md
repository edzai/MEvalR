# üìä MEvalR: Monitoring & Evaluation Toolkit for R

**MEvalR** is an open-source R package designed to support **Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E)** professionals working on development programs, social impact initiatives, and policy interventions. The package streamlines the end-to-end M&E workflow‚Äîfrom defining a Theory of Change (ToC) to conducting causal analysis and generating stakeholder-ready impact reports.

## üîç Overview

**MEvalR** allows users to:
- Define their **Theory of Change (ToC)** or **Logic Model**
- Upload initiative/program data
- Automatically evaluate alignment between plans and results
- Conduct **causal inference** (e.g., DiD, PSM, DAGs)
- Generate rich, interactive **impact reports** in PDF, Word, or HTML

|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `define_toc()`         | Create a structured Theory of Change from templates or data frames          |
| `load_data()`          | Import and validate M&E datasets (CSV, Excel)                               |
| `evaluate_alignment()` | Analyze alignment between planned indicators and observed data              |

## üíª Optional UI (Shiny App)

A companion **Shiny app** (coming soon!) will allow users to:
- Upload ToC and datasets interactively
- Visually design DAGs
- Perform causal tests with intuitive controls
- View and download reports from a dashboard
